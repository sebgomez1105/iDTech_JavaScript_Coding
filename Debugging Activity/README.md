# Debugging Activity
For this activity I first started with the first 
checkpoint which its task was to stop an infiite 
loop and instead just go from 0 to 100 using even 
numbers. For this one you just had to change the x 
variable, change the while loop so that the x is 
smaller than 100, and you had to use the "%" to get 
the restants of the division.

For the second checkpoint, the task was that every 
student should get a student ID, and their ID 
numbers should range from 0 to 4.

For the third activity you had to get the change from what you paid for in the supermarket which you had $50 and paid for a $4.99 milk, $15.99 vegetables, and a $2.99 bread.
